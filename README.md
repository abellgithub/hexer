# Hexer - Hexbin density and boundary generation

Hexer is a [LGPL] C++ library that provides some classes for generating 
hexbin density surfaces and [multipolygon] boundaries for large point sets. I use 
the code for generating boundary polygons of large [LiDAR] collections, but it is 
useful in other contexts.
